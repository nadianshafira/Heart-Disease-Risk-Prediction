## AIM
This project aimed to predict whether someone is diagnosed with heart disease or not using 5 classification algorithm at first (KNN, SVM, Deciison Tree, Random Forest, and AdaBoosting), then I picked the best one based on the recall score.

## CONCLUSION
Findings reveal that SVM is the best model to predict the heart disease risk of people with an 84% recall score, which means the model is 84% accurately able to predict heart disease.
